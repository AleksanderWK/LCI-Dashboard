# LCI Dashboard

LCI Dashboard gives insight into students' learning experience by visualizing multimodal data variables in a user-friendly dashboard.

The program is divided into two; a [`backend`](backend/README.md) and a [`frontend`](frontend/README.md), each in their own folder.

The backend is a program used to connect to a dashboard with a session token, retrieve data from either devices or a dataset, compute different multimodal data variables and send the results to the connected dashboard in real-time.

The frontend is an application to create learning sessions for students to connect to, visualize the live data from the sessions in a dashboard, and record sessions to be able to view the data afterwards.
